# contentEditableCaret.js

contentEditableCaret.js is a lightweight JavaScrpt plugin to allow you to move the caret (or cursor) position in a contentEditable element.

You can set the caret position in your contentEditable element by providing the string.

```
<div id="content" contenteditable="true">
Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.
</div>

<button onclick="onClickButton()">Focus</button>

<script>
	const element = document.getElementById( 'content' );
	function onClickButton(){
		contentEditableCaret( element, 'Boo', true, false  );
	}
</script>
```
